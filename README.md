Disease prediction app


This is one of major project of my undergraduate degree program.

Here, I have developed a disease predicting web app which using the concept of machine learning makes predictions about various diseases like Malaria, Pneumonia, Diabetes etc.

Down below are the names of the various model files used:
Cancer model = model

Diabetes model = model1

Heart model = model2

Liver model = model4

Kidney model = model3

Malaria model = model111.h5

Pneumonia model = my_model.h5

Kernals used for training deep learning model
Kernal for Malaria model :https://www.kaggle.com/shobhit18th/malaria-cell

Kernal for Pneumonia model :https://www.kaggle.com/shobhit18th/keras-nn-x-ray-predict-pneumonia-86-54

Details of various datasets used for model development :
Cancer : cancer.csv [In the repository]

Diabetes : diabetes.csv [In the repository]

Heart : heart.csv [In the repository]

Liver : https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/indian-liver-patient-records

Kidney : https://www.kaggle.com/mansoordaku/ckdisease

Malaria : https://www.kaggle.com/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria

Pneumonia: https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

Tools used for project development:
Python ( 3.7 version)

Flask

OpenCV

Pandas

Numpy

HTML

CSS

For using the project clone the repository and type the following commands in the termial:
$ set FLASK_APP= app.py
$ flask run
Thank you!
